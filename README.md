**Fundamentals**

**THE APP USE HOOKS**

```


Hooks is one of the updated modules in react which empasizes the use of functional based  components.

(a)UseState

Helps us use the state within a functional  component.

(b)UseEffect

Mimics the Lifecyle class Method.
It is the one that brings the change to the state while  using hooks.

It makes a call to the second parameter method.
eg componentDidMount

```

**MORE BASICS**
```
You  should not use async await to the UseEffect Method direclty whatsoever.
Instead create another method from inside the UseEffect() and call asyc await
example when you are fetching posts  from an external API.


```
